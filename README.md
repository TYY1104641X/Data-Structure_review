# Data-Structure_review
Review main data strutures by both Python and C

The folder contains two files, one by Python and another by C.

For the .cpp file, I mainly reviewed basic operations in C, including add, bit, and logic operations, integers, array, data types, pointer, structure, linkedlist. 

For the .py file, I reviewed the most frequent structures including list, dictionary, tuple, set, linkedlist, tree, and stack.
