Review main data strutures by both Python and C

The folder contains two files, one by Python and another by C. Note that some codes are from other reference sources listed in the corresponding files. Please feel free to let me delete them if they infringe on your copyrights.

For the .cpp file, I mainly reviewed basic operations in C, including add, bit, and logic operations, integers, array, data types, pointer, structure, linkedlist. 

For the .py file, I reviewed the most frequent structures including list, dictionary, tuple, set, linkedlist, tree, and stack.
